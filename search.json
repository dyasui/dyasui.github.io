    "section": "",
    "text": "Internal migration can be an adaptation to large-scale climate shocks. The Dust Bowl of the 1930s in the US is often cited as an example of a large-scale example of a sudden mass exodus caused by the drought and dust storms of that period. However, I highlight new evidence that the observed westward migrations during this period away from the Midwest towards California were part of existing long-term trends. I use linked census data to estimate cross-county migration rates for the decades leading up to and including the Dust Bowl years (1900s, 1910s, 1920s, and 1940s). Compared to the early twentieth century estimates, the rates of migration out of affected areas were no higher than unaffected counties. However, there is a change in the rates of migration into the counties in the dust areas. This evidence highlights the need to be careful when using net migration rates which abstract away from differences in in vs out-migration."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Japanese internment during World War II serves as a natural experiment to analyse the effects of the forcibly relocated population’s new locations on their annual earnings. Attributing differences in economic mobility between migrants and non-migrants is difficult because migrants often move because they have opportunities which may be unavailable to non-migrants such as education. However, the population of Japanese Americans who were forced to evacuate the West Coast in 1942, their later locations were affected through mechanisms outside of their control. By comparing these individuals against similar inidividuals who were not evacuated, I identify the causal effect of this relocation on the differences in annual earnings before and after internment. I find that individuals who were likely interned experienced faster growth in earnings compared to their counterfactual earnings if they had not been interned. The possible mechaisms which might explain this seeming adaptation include occupational change and later migration decisions."
