Internal migration can be an adaptation to large-scale climate shocks.
The Dust Bowl of the 1930s in the US is often cited as an example of a large-scale example of a sudden mass exodus caused by the drought and dust storms of that period.
However, I highlight new evidence that the observed westward migrations during this period away from the Midwest towards California were part of existing long-term trends.
I use linked census data to estimate cross-county migration rates for the decades leading up to and including the Dust Bowl years (1900s, 1910s, 1920s, and 1940s).
Compared to the early twentieth century estimates, the rates of migration out of affected areas were no higher than unaffected counties. 
However, there is a change in the rates of migration into the counties in the dust areas. 
This evidence highlights the need to be careful when using net migration rates which abstract away from differences in in vs out-migration.
