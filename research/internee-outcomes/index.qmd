Japanese internment during World War II serves as a natural experiment to analyse the effects of the forcibly relocated population's new locations on their annual earnings.
Attributing differences in economic mobility between migrants and non-migrants is difficult because migrants often move because they have opportunities which may be unavailable to non-migrants such as education.
However, the population of Japanese Americans who were forced to evacuate the West Coast in 1942, their later locations were affected through mechanisms outside of their control.
By comparing these individuals against similar inidividuals who were not evacuated, I identify the causal effect of this relocation on the differences in annual earnings before and after internment.
I find that individuals who were likely interned experienced faster growth in earnings compared to their counterfactual earnings if they had not been interned.
The possible mechaisms which might explain this seeming adaptation include occupational change and later migration decisions.
